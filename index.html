    <a href="http://aubourguignondumarais.fr/" target="blank">Here is a restaurant I ate at that I thought was really cute.</a>
    <h4>This is what I ate there:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Boeuf Bourguignon (delicious, basically fancy beef stew)</li>
<li>Soupe au pois froude au bacon (cold pea soup, better than it sounds)</li>
<li>Andouillette (not to be confused with Andouille sausage, basically smelled and tasted like fresh colon and intestine of a pig, zero stars, would not recommend)</li>
<li>And wine, of course</li>
</ul>
